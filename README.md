## Technical overview
The GuiEngine utilizes an interpreted component-based approach to render GUIs effectively. With the help of components, developers can seamlessly create content that enhances the visual appeal of your GUIs.

The true power of the GuiEngine lies in its interpreter, which enables users to work with simple config files, shielding them from the underlying complexity. This means that users don't need to dive into the complicated coding details to craft their dreams GUI, making the process much more accessible and user-friendly.

Furthermore, GuiEngine supports both functions and placeholders. Functions act as actions triggered when specific events occur, providing dynamic functionality to the GUIs. Placeholders, on the other hand, offer a way for developers to pass values from their plugins to the GUI, allowing for graphical representation of data.

Overall, GuiEngine streamlines GUI development by simplifying configuration and enabling the integration of dynamic actions and data representation without requiring advanced coding knowledge. This empowers developers and server owners alike to craft visually appealing and functional GUIs with ease.
